Next steps to troubleshoot:
Please run this command to see the actual image pull error:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc describe pod rook-ceph-operator-655894bbf-xs458 -n rook-ceph
Look specifically in the Events section for lines like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Failed to pull image "...": ...
üîç Possible root causes based on your symptoms:
1. Image name mismatch
Check if the image in the pod spec is exactly:

text
Copy
Edit
sd-wv58-kflz.nam.nsroot.net:5000/rook/ceph:master
To verify:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get deployment rook-ceph-operator -n rook-ceph -o=jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[*].image}'
Make sure it matches the image you pushed to your custom registry.

2. Docker credentials not picked up
You‚Äôve patched the rook-ceph-operator SA, but we should verify that the pod is using this service account:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get pod rook-ceph-operator-655894bbf-xs458 -n rook-ceph -o=jsonpath='{.spec.serviceAccountName}'
If this shows empty or default, the credentials from rook-ceph-operator SA won‚Äôt be used. You‚Äôd then need to either:

Edit the deployment to set:

yaml
Copy
Edit
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: rook-ceph-operator
Or

Patch the default SA instead.

‚úÖ Optional: Check if your secret is visible to the pod
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get secret -n rook-ceph
