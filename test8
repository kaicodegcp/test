Step 1: Verify the Registry Access
Run the following command to check if the registry is reachable:

sh
Copy
Edit
curl -k -v http://sd-cwdz-kcu9.nam.nsroot.net:5000/v2/
401 Unauthorized → Your credentials are required or incorrect.

403 Forbidden → You don’t have permission to access the registry.

404 Not Found → The registry service might not be running.

If you still get 403 Forbidden, continue with the next steps.

Step 2: Verify Your Docker Credentials
Manually test your credentials:

sh
Copy
Edit
echo -n "admin:your-password" | base64
Then, verify your current Docker config:

sh
Copy
Edit
cat ~/.docker/config.json
If the auth value looks incorrect, delete and reconfigure your credentials.

To reset:

sh
Copy
Edit
rm -rf ~/.docker/config.json
docker logout http://sd-cwdz-kcu9.nam.nsroot.net:5000
Then, try logging in again:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker login http://sd-cwdz-kcu9.nam.nsroot.net:5000
If it still fails, verify that your username and password are correct.
