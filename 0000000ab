Step 1: Remove any conflicting certs in openshift-config
bash
Copy
Edit
oc delete configmap registry-certs -n openshift-config
Also, check and remove any other outdated or alternate certs:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get configmap -n openshift-config
Delete any custom cert ConfigMap (e.g. registry-ca-cert, my-registry-cert, etc.) that could override:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc delete configmap my-registry-cert -n openshift-config
✅ Step 2: Recreate ConfigMap with only the correct old domain.crt
Make sure this is the cert used during docker image push to the registry and works on xyz cluster.

bash
Copy
Edit
oc create configmap registry-certs \
  --from-file=sd-wv58-kflz.nam.nsroot.net.crt=/root/domain.crt \
  -n openshift-config
✅ Step 3: Patch global trust to use only registry-certs
bash
Copy
Edit
oc patch proxy/cluster --type=merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"trustedCA":{"name":"registry-certs"}}}'
✅ Step 4: Confirm patch is applied
bash
Copy
Edit
oc get proxy/cluster -o yaml | grep trustedCA
Ensure it reflects:

yaml
Copy
Edit
trustedCA:
  name: registry-certs
✅ Step 5: Force all nodes to refresh trust
You cannot use oc delete machine if you're not using the openshift-machine-api.

Instead, use this workaround to force re-pull images from registry with updated trust:

Reboot nodes manually if you have access.
OR

Force re-pull by removing the pod and making a minimal spec change:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc delete pod test-cert-a -n nacho-cds
oc run test-cert-a --image=sd-wv58-kflz.nam.nsroot.net:5000/cdp-private/cloudera/redhat8/postgresql-10:1-215 \
  --env=POSTGRESQL_USER=admin \
  --env=POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=admin123 \
  --env=POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=testdb \
  --restart=Never -n nacho-cds
✅ Step 6: Confirm certs are respected via curl on the node
From bdgtr076x11t1 (assuming it's shared or has certs installed), run:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -v --cacert /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/domain.crt https://sd-wv58-kflz.nam.nsroot.net:5000/v2/
✅ Optional Debug
To verify if image is being blocked by cert:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc logs <pod-name> -n nacho-cds
oc describe pod test-cert-a -n nacho-cds
Look for x509: certificate signed by unknown authority → indicates trust issue.

Let me know once done or if you want help generating a YAML version of these updates.
