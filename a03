Let's Troubleshoot in 3 Clear Steps:
Step 1: Check if vault-0 pod exists
bash
Copy
Edit
oc get pods -n xyz | grep vault
If it doesn't show up, then something is wrong with StatefulSet creation.

Step 2: Check Persistent Volume Claims
Vault uses a StatefulSet, which requires PVCs to be created.

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get pvc -n xyz
If it says "No resources found", this confirms the PVC wasn't bound (and Cloudera's wizard will time out waiting for it).

Step 3: Check storage class is defined and default
You previously had:

cpp
Copy
Edit
sc-ontap-nas (default)   csi.trident.netapp.io
âœ… Ensure this class exists and is set as default:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get sc
If not default, set it:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc patch storageclass sc-ontap-nas -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
ðŸ“Œ Next Action Plan
Once PVCs can bind correctly, the Vault pod should auto-retry and come up.

Then you can:
âœ… Retry the wizard again.

Would you please send output of:

oc get pods -n xyz | grep vault

oc get pvc -n xyz

oc get sc

And Iâ€™ll confirm what to fix exactly.
