Step-by-Step: Manually Test vault-0 Pod
Here’s how to simulate it and validate image pull, TLS, and startup:

🛠️ 1. Create a test pod YAML for vault-0
Save this YAML as vault-test.yaml (you can vi or cat > vault-test.yaml):

yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: vault-0
  namespace: xyz
spec:
  containers:
  - name: vault
    image: sd-wv58-kflz.nam.nsroot.net:5000/vault:latest
    command: ["vault"]
    args: ["server", "-dev"]
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8200
  restartPolicy: Never
  imagePullSecrets:
  - name: docker-creds
Optional: You can change "vault server -dev" to any basic test command like ["sleep", "3600"] to avoid needing config.

🚀 2. Apply the test pod:
bash
Copy
Edit
oc apply -f vault-test.yaml
Then check:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get pods -n xyz -w
🧪 3. Inspect logs and status
Once pod starts (or fails), run:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc describe pod vault-0 -n xyz
oc logs vault-0 -n xyz
If it fails with ImagePullBackOff, the image or registry access is broken again. If it runs, then Vault is ready, and the issue is narrowed to Cloudera install logic.
