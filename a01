oc get pods -n xyz -w
When vault-0 appears, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc describe pod vault-0 -n xyz
And check if it's:

stuck in ImagePullBackOff

failing on PVC

or failing to run the container

âœ… 2. Check PVC Binding
bash
Copy
Edit
oc get pvc -n xyz
If you see vault-statefulset PVC in Pending, your rook/ceph provisioner is not working. In that case:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get pods -n rook-ceph
Ensure rook-ceph-operator and ceph-related pods are all in Running.

ðŸ§© Tips Based on Your Setup
You've now successfully:

Loaded rook/ceph:master image

Pushed it to your internal registry

Patched service account with imagePullSecrets

âœ… So, Docker credentials are no longer the issue.

ðŸ”§ What to Try Next
Please run and share:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc describe pod vault-0 -n xyz
oc get pvc -n xyz
oc get events -n xyz --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp




Push Rook-Ceph Image to Your Internal Registry
You probably already have:

bash
Copy
Edit
rook/ceph:master
But Cloudera may need a specific tag.

Try inspecting the failing pod:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc describe pod rook-ceph-operator-5bd7d95bf6-fd6vz -n rook-ceph
Get the image name. Then:

bash
Copy
Edit
# If image is for example rook/ceph:v1.8.8
docker tag rook/ceph:v1.8.8 sd-wv58-kflz.nam.nsroot.net:5000/rook/ceph:v1.8.8
docker push sd-wv58-kflz.nam.nsroot.net:5000/rook/ceph:v1.8.8
Step 2: Patch ImagePullSecret for rook-ceph
bash
Copy
Edit
oc patch sa default -n rook-ceph \
  -p '{"imagePullSecrets": [{"name": "docker-creds"}]}'
Step 3: Delete & Let It Restart
bash
Copy
Edit
oc delete pod rook-ceph-operator-5bd7d95bf6-fd6vz -n rook-ceph
Let it pull the image from your secured internal registry.

ðŸŸ¢ Then, Resume
Once rook-ceph-operator is Running and PVCs are successfully created, you can safely click Retry in the Cloudera UI.

Let me know the result of:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc describe pod rook-ceph-operator-xxx -n rook-ceph
