1. 🔍 Check if the deployment exists
bash
Copy
Edit
oc get deploy rook-ceph-operator -n rook-ceph
If this returns nothing, then the operator deployment is missing. It needs to be created or fixed.

2. 🔍 Check deployment conditions
bash
Copy
Edit
oc describe deploy rook-ceph-operator -n rook-ceph
This will show if the deployment is misconfigured (e.g., paused, no replicas, invalid template, etc.)

3. 🔍 Check service account & secret association
Verify the service account used is correct and secret is referenced:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get serviceaccount rook-ceph-operator -n rook-ceph -o yaml
It should include:

yaml
Copy
Edit
imagePullSecrets:
- name: docker-creds
4. 🔁 Try manually scaling the deployment
If rollout restart didn’t trigger pod recreation:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc scale deployment rook-ceph-operator --replicas=0 -n rook-ceph
sleep 5
oc scale deployment rook-ceph-operator --replicas=1 -n rook-ceph
Then again:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get pods -n rook-ceph -w
Once a new pod is up, if it goes into ImagePullBackOff, describe it:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc describe pod <pod-name> -n rook-ceph
