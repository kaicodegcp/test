Step-by-Step Fix with oc adm Commands
ðŸ”¹ 1. Ensure the ServiceAccount drs-admin Exists
bash
Copy
Edit
oc get sa drs-admin -n cdp || oc create sa drs-admin -n cdp
ðŸ”¹ 2. Grant Required Permissions to drs-admin
âœ… Option A: Grant Minimal Permissions (Recommended)
This gives just enough permissions for Vault authentication:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user \
  system:auth-delegator \
  -z drs-admin \
  -n cdp
This allows Vault to:

Verify service account tokens

Perform token review

âœ… Option B: (Optional) Allow Reading Pod/ServiceAccount Info (some Vault setups require)
bash
Copy
Edit
oc adm policy add-role-to-user \
  view \
  -z drs-admin \
  -n cdp
This allows:

Reading pods

Reading service account metadata

ðŸ”¹ 3. (If Needed) Allow Anyuid SCC for the Vault Pod
If your Vault pod needs to run as root or a non-default UID:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid \
  -z drs-admin \
  -n cdp
âœ… This step is only needed if Vault is crashing due to user permission issues (not mandatory for auth).

ðŸ“Œ Next: Vault-Side Role Must Match
Once youâ€™ve fixed permissions with oc adm, make sure your Vault role configuration matches:

bash
Copy
Edit
vault write auth/kubernetes/role/cdp-role \
  bound_service_account_names=drs-admin \
  bound_service_account_namespaces=cdp \
  policies=default \
  ttl=24h
