Re-run these exact working commands:
1. Load rook-ceph image from the .tar again:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker load -i rook-ceph-master.tar
2. Tag it properly for your registry:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker tag rook/ceph:master sd-wv58-kflz.nam.nsroot.net:5000/rook/ceph:master
3. Push it into your private registry:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker push sd-wv58-kflz.nam.nsroot.net:5000/rook/ceph:master
You should see all layers pushed or marked as "already exists".

🚀 Then:
Once the push is successful:

Restart rook-ceph-operator:
bash
Copy
Edit
oc delete pod -n rook-ceph -l app=rook-ceph-operator
🔁 After ~1–2 mins, check:
bash
Copy
Edit
oc get pods -n rook-ceph
Make sure rook-ceph-operator shows Running.

Then retry your CDP install wizard (Retry button), and the Vault pod (vault-0) should get created along with its PVC.

Let me know once rook-ceph-operator is Running — I’ll help validate Vault right after that.
