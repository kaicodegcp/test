Fix: Patch the ServiceAccount in namespace xyz
Run the following:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc patch serviceaccount default -n xyz \
  -p '{"imagePullSecrets": [{"name": "docker-creds"}]}'
✅ You already did this earlier — but the vault-0 pod was probably created before the patch or didn’t pick it up.

🔁 Now: Delete and Recreate vault-0 Pod
To retry with proper auth:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc delete pod vault-0 -n xyz
oc apply -f vault-test.yaml
Make sure vault-test.yaml has this line under spec:

yaml
Copy
Edit
  imagePullSecrets:
  - name: docker-creds
Then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get pod vault-0 -n xyz -w
