Root Cause from Logs
The log clearly points to rook/ceph PVC binding failure:

there are unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaims

This means:

Your OpenShift cluster is trying to provision storage using rook-ceph for Vault,

But no dynamic provisioner is successfully fulfilling the PersistentVolumeClaim request.

✅ Action Items to Resolve
Check Vault PVC Status:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get pvc -n xyz
Look for PVCs like vault-data-xyz-0 or similar that are stuck in Pending state.

Check if a StorageClass is available and default:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get sc
Look for:

A default storage class marked with (default)

That supports ReadWriteOnce or ReadWriteOncePod

If no default StorageClass is set or if rook-ceph is failing, you must fix this before Vault will deploy.

Check rook-ceph pods for issues (if you are using rook):

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get pods -n rook-ceph
And to describe them:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc describe pod <rook-ceph-operator-pod> -n rook-ceph
Temporary Fix: Use Manual PVC Binding
If dynamic provisioning fails, you can:

Manually create a PersistentVolume

Then bind it to the Vault PVC

But ideally, fixing your dynamic provisioner (e.g. rook-ceph) is the best path forward.

✅ Optional — Check Events for PVC Binding Failures
bash
Copy
Edit
oc get events -n xyz --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'
Look for lines like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
FailedScheduling - no persistent volumes available for this claim
Let me know what the PVC status shows, or if you'd like help setting a temporary static volume to proceed with Vault.
