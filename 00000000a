Enhancing Python Environment Consistency and Reliability
The EAP Strategic Solutions team completed the cleanup of Python 2.7 references across Ansible playbooks and implemented a softlink from python to python3.8. This change standardizes the Python environment, preventing OS-level VTM breakages and ensuring consistency across deployments.

What was achieved:
Successfully removed legacy Python 2.7 dependencies from all server installation playbooks.
Replaced python binary links with python3.8, ensuring compatibility and standardization.
Verified Impala shell execution and application testing on edge nodes with the new configuration.

Benefit to the team:

Prevents OS VTM failures due to unsupported Python 2.7 references.

Ensures all EAP applications and edge nodes utilize a consistent and secure Python 3.8 runtime.

Reduces future maintenance overhead and simplifies environment setup.

Next steps:

Begin 30-day plan to eliminate Python 2 from all SDLC servers across application edge and operations-managed clusters.

Monitor for compatibility issues and collect feedback from application teams during the transition.
