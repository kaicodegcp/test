1. Check Vault ServiceAccount Permissions
In xyz, check which ServiceAccount was used and if it has permissions to authenticate with Vault:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get serviceaccount -n xyz
oc describe serviceaccount default -n xyz
oc get rolebindings,clusterrolebindings -n xyz | grep default
Then replicate same RBAC in cdp2:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc describe serviceaccount default -n cdp2
oc get rolebindings,clusterrolebindings -n cdp2 | grep default
You may need to bind a ClusterRole to allow access:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:cdp2:default
Or replicate the exact rolebindings from xyz.

✅ 2. Verify vault-0 Pod Logs
Check if vault-0 pod is healthy in cdp2:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get pods -n cdp2 | grep vault
oc logs vault-0 -n cdp2
If vault-0 is not ready, or failing TLS/auth, Vault login will break.

✅ 3. Check if Certs/ConfigMaps Are Identical
Verify if registry-certs and TLS ConfigMaps from xyz were properly replicated to cdp2.

Run this in both namespaces and compare:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get configmap -n xyz
oc get configmap -n cdp2
Specifically check:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc describe configmap registry-certs -n xyz
oc describe configmap registry-certs -n cdp2
Also check if vault pod is mounting those certs in cdp2.

✅ 4. Confirm Vault Endpoint and DNS Reachability
From the Cloudera Manager host or inside a pod:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -vk https://vault-cdp2-vault.apps.mlab-.../v1/sys/health
You should see HTTP/2 200 or HTTP/2 429 (Vault ready).
If it's 403, it confirms permission issue.

✅ Final Fix Steps Summary
✅ Ensure the default ServiceAccount in cdp2 has same RBAC as xyz (use oc adm policy).

✅ Ensure ConfigMaps, Secrets, and TLS certs in cdp2 are copied exactly from working xyz.

✅ Validate vault-0 pod is healthy and ready (oc logs vault-0 -n cdp2).

✅ Test Vault API login manually with curl to identify token/auth failure reason.

✅ Optionally bind cluster-admin temporarily for troubleshooting:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:cdp2:default
