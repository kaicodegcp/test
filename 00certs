Manual TLS Cert Trust on RHEL-based Host (e.g., bdgtr076x11t1)
🔹 Step 1: Copy cert to system trust anchors
bash
Copy
Edit
cp /root/domain_xyz.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
🔹 Step 2: Update CA trust store
bash
Copy
Edit
update-ca-trust extract
🔍 This command integrates the cert into system-wide trust for all applications including Docker/Podman and curl.

🔹 Step 3: Restart Docker (if applicable)
bash
Copy
Edit
systemctl restart docker
Or if you're using CRI-O (on OpenShift nodes, which you can't access directly), this won't apply. But on bdgtr076x11t1 — if Docker is pulling images locally (e.g., for proxy), this step is needed.

🔹 Step 4: Test curl against Docker registry (as verification)
bash
Copy
Edit
curl -v --cacert /root/domain_xyz.crt https://sd-wv58-kflz.nam.nsroot.net:5000/v2/
You should not see x509: certificate signed by unknown authority.
