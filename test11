1. Search for "403" Errors in Logs
Run this command to find lines mentioning 403:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker logs eap_registry 2>&1 | grep "403"
This will directly show 403 errors instead of scrolling through huge logs.

2. Check Authentication & Authorization Logs
If you suspect authentication issues, filter logs for relevant messages:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker logs eap_registry 2>&1 | grep -i "auth"
If you're using a token-based authentication system, it may indicate missing credentials.

3. Inspect Registry Configuration
Check if your registry is using authentication by looking at the registry configuration file (if applicable).

sh
Copy
Edit
docker exec -it eap_registry cat /etc/docker/registry/config.yml
Look for authentication and access control settings.

4. Verify Running Services & Ports
Ensure your registry is running on the correct port (e.g., 5000):

sh
Copy
Edit
docker ps | grep eap_registry
If it's using TLS (HTTPS) but youâ€™re trying to log in via HTTP, you might need to configure insecure-registries.

5. Enable Debug Logging (If Necessary)
To get more details, restart the container with debug mode:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker run -d --name eap_registry -e REGISTRY_LOG_LEVEL=debug registry:2
This will provide deeper insights into why authentication is failing.
