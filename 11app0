The EAP Strategic Solutions team successfully deployed the control plane of Cloudera Data Services (CDS) on Red Hat OpenShift. This enables containerized CDE/CDW services for EAP teams, allowing faster, scalable, and secure Spark and data warehouse workloads without traditional VM overhead. The deployment modernizes infrastructure, aligns with DevOps practices, and empowers teams to self-manage environments.

Benefits:

Accelerated deployment and job provisioning

Optimized resource usage and reduced waste

Enhanced security via Kubernetes/OpenShift

Self-managed infrastructure for flexibility

Next Steps:
Focus on configuring CDS for lab environments and expanding adoption across use cases in the next 30 days.


Who did what:
The EAP Strategic Solutions team validated and upgraded the Citiconda parcel to citiconda39-9.9.46.parcel, resolving prior issues with critical Python modules (oracledb, gssapi, and paramiko).

What was achieved:
Successfully tested and confirmed compatibility of required modules using the new parcel version, ensuring smoother runtime support for secure and database-integrated workloads.

Benefit to the team:

Eliminates environment setup errors

Accelerates job readiness for data and analytics teams

Ensures consistent and reliable Python runtime for CDS workloads on OpenShift

Next steps:
Roll out the updated parcel across environments and document the module testing steps for broader team adoption.
