Sure! Hereâ€™s a complete set of commands along with a simple YAML file for deploying a basic app (NGINX) on OpenShift, which you can use as a reference to deploy other services.

1. Log in to OpenShift (if you are not logged in already):
bash
Copy
Edit
oc login <openshift-cluster-url>
2. Create or Switch to the Namespace:
bash
Copy
Edit
oc create namespace cti-svcs-eap-cds-on-ecs-165345-test
oc project cti-svcs-eap-cds-on-ecs-165345-test
3. Create Deployment and Service YAML File
Create a new file deployment-and-service.yaml and copy the following content:

yaml
Copy
Edit
# deployment-and-service.yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sample-deployment
  namespace: cti-svcs-eap-cds-on-ecs-165345-test
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sample-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sample-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: sample-service
  namespace: cti-svcs-eap-cds-on-ecs-165345-test
spec:
  selector:
    app: sample-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
4. Apply the YAML File to Deploy the Resources:
Run the following commands to deploy the application and service:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc apply -f deployment-and-service.yaml -n cti-svcs-eap-cds-on-ecs-165345-test
5. Verify the Deployment:
Check if the pods are running correctly:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get pods -n cti-svcs-eap-cds-on-ecs-165345-test
Check if the service is created:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc get svc -n cti-svcs-eap-cds-on-ecs-165345-test
6. Expose the Service (Optional):
If you need to access the service externally, you can expose it as a route:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc expose svc/sample-service -n cti-svcs-eap-cds-on-ecs-165345-test
This will give you a URL to access the NGINX service in your browser.

Summary of Commands:
bash
Copy
Edit
# 1. Log in to OpenShift
oc login <openshift-cluster-url>

# 2. Create or Switch to Namespace
oc create namespace cti-svcs-eap-cds-on-ecs-165345-test
oc project cti-svcs-eap-cds-on-ecs-165345-test

# 3. Apply YAML File for Deployment and Service
oc apply -f deployment-and-service.yaml -n cti-svcs-eap-cds-on-ecs-165345-test

# 4. Verify Pods and Services
oc get pods -n cti-svcs-eap-cds-on-ecs-165345-test
oc get svc -n cti-svcs-eap-cds-on-ecs-165345-test

# 5. Expose the Service (Optional)
oc expose svc/sample-service -n cti-svcs-eap-cds-on-ecs-165345-test
You can now copy and use this YAML file for deploying services and verify the setup in your OpenShift cluster.
