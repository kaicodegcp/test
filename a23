CephCluster is in HEALTH_OK
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc -n rook-ceph get cephcluster
You should see something like:

bash
Copy
Edit
NAME             DATADIRHOSTPATH   MONCOUNT   HEALTH      ...
rook-ceph        /var/lib/rook     3          HEALTH_OK
2. Ceph Toolbox (Optional but helpful)
Deploy this if you want to run ceph status or inspect pools:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc -n rook-ceph apply -f toolbox.yaml
oc -n rook-ceph exec -it deploy/rook-ceph-tools -- ceph status
