1. ✅ Create the ClusterRoleBinding (or check if it exists)
Run the following to grant cluster-admin temporarily (for debugging; we’ll restrict later if needed):

bash
Copy
Edit
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:rook-ceph:rook-ceph-operator
Alternatively, for more restrictive permissions, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin system:serviceaccount:rook-ceph:rook-ceph-operator -n rook-ceph
2. 🔁 Restart the Deployment
bash
Copy
Edit
oc rollout restart deployment rook-ceph-operator -n rook-ceph
3. ✅ Check Pod Status
bash
Copy
Edit
oc get pods -n rook-ceph -w
