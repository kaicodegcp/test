The error in your screenshot indicates a problem with the kubeconfig file, specifically a duplicate name issue in the contexts section. This means your kubeconfig contains multiple entries with the same name (eap_dev), causing conflicts.

Fix the Kubeconfig Duplicate Context Issue
Check the Kubeconfig File:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat ~/.kube/config
Look for multiple entries of eap_dev under contexts.

Manually Remove Duplicates:

Open the kubeconfig file in a text editor:

bash
Copy
Edit
vi ~/.kube/config
Identify and remove the duplicate contexts entries for eap_dev.

Save and exit.

Validate the Kubeconfig: After editing, check if it works:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc config view --minify
oc get nodes
If this works, retry your installation.

Test Context Switching:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc config get-contexts
oc config use-context <valid-context-name>
Retry the Installation: Once fixed, retry running your install-cdp.sh script.

Let me know if you still face issues! 🚀

Since you're running the install-cdp.sh script through the Cloudera Console, you need to fix the kubeconfig file on the installation host where the script is being executed. Follow these steps:

1️⃣ Identify the Installation Host
Since you're deploying Cloudera Data Services (CDS) on OpenShift, the installation host is the machine where Cloudera Manager (CM) or the bootstrap script (install-cdp.sh) is running. You likely need to log in to the machine where this script is executing.

If you have direct SSH access, log in to the installation host:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh <your-installation-host>
If you're unsure, check which machine runs the deployment script from Cloudera Manager.

2️⃣ Check the Kubeconfig File
Once logged in to the installation host, check the kubeconfig file location. The error message suggests the kubeconfig is stored in /data/l/tmp/. Verify its contents:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat /data/l/tmp/download-and-execute-6bc996cb-34d2-406b-ac23-ca8da92349fd/kubeconfig
Or check the default location:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat ~/.kube/config
3️⃣ Remove Duplicate Context Entries
Open the kubeconfig file:

bash
Copy
Edit
vi /data/l/tmp/download-and-execute-6bc996cb-34d2-406b-ac23-ca8da92349fd/kubeconfig
Find and remove duplicate contexts named eap_dev.

Each context entry starts with - context:

Ensure there is only one unique entry per cluster.

Save and exit (Esc → :wq).

4️⃣ Validate the Kubeconfig
After fixing the file, test the OpenShift connection:

bash
Copy
Edit
export KUBECONFIG=/data/l/tmp/download-and-execute-6bc996cb-34d2-406b-ac23-ca8da92349fd/kubeconfig
oc config get-contexts
oc config use-context <valid-context-name>
oc get nodes
If the issue persists, try setting the correct kubeconfig for Cloudera:

bash
Copy
Edit
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config

oc patch storageclass <STORAGE_CLASS_NAME> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations": {"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class": "true"}}}'
