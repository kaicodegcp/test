The error in your screenshot indicates a problem with the kubeconfig file, specifically a duplicate name issue in the contexts section. This means your kubeconfig contains multiple entries with the same name (eap_dev), causing conflicts.

Fix the Kubeconfig Duplicate Context Issue
Check the Kubeconfig File:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat ~/.kube/config
Look for multiple entries of eap_dev under contexts.

Manually Remove Duplicates:

Open the kubeconfig file in a text editor:

bash
Copy
Edit
vi ~/.kube/config
Identify and remove the duplicate contexts entries for eap_dev.

Save and exit.

Validate the Kubeconfig: After editing, check if it works:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc config view --minify
oc get nodes
If this works, retry your installation.

Test Context Switching:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc config get-contexts
oc config use-context <valid-context-name>
Retry the Installation: Once fixed, retry running your install-cdp.sh script.

Let me know if you still face issues! üöÄ

where it fix im running through Cloudera Console so where to login is CM admin or installtion host?

Since you're running the install-cdp.sh script through the Cloudera Console, you need to fix the kubeconfig file on the installation host where the script is being executed. Follow these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the Installation Host
Since you're deploying Cloudera Data Services (CDS) on OpenShift, the installation host is the machine where Cloudera Manager (CM) or the bootstrap script (install-cdp.sh) is running. You likely need to log in to the machine where this script is executing.

If you have direct SSH access, log in to the installation host:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh <your-installation-host>
If you're unsure, check which machine runs the deployment script from Cloudera Manager.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Check the Kubeconfig File
Once logged in to the installation host, check the kubeconfig file location. The error message suggests the kubeconfig is stored in /data/l/tmp/. Verify its contents:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat /data/l/tmp/download-and-execute-6bc996cb-34d2-406b-ac23-ca8da92349fd/kubeconfig
Or check the default location:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat ~/.kube/config
3Ô∏è‚É£ Remove Duplicate Context Entries
Open the kubeconfig file:

bash
Copy
Edit
vi /data/l/tmp/download-and-execute-6bc996cb-34d2-406b-ac23-ca8da92349fd/kubeconfig
Find and remove duplicate contexts named eap_dev.

Each context entry starts with - context:

Ensure there is only one unique entry per cluster.

Save and exit (Esc ‚Üí :wq).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Validate the Kubeconfig
After fixing the file, test the OpenShift connection:

bash
Copy
Edit
export KUBECONFIG=/data/l/tmp/download-and-execute-6bc996cb-34d2-406b-ac23-ca8da92349fd/kubeconfig
oc config get-contexts
oc config use-context <valid-context-name>
oc get nodes
If the issue persists, try setting the correct kubeconfig for Cloudera:

bash
Copy
Edit
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config

oc patch storageclass <STORAGE_CLASS_NAME> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations": {"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class": "true"}}}'


The errors in your screenshot indicate two primary issues:

Incorrect Docker Registry Credentials

Rook/Ceph-related Unbound PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)

Since you have the Docker user ID and password, follow these steps to resolve the issue:

Step 1: Update Docker Credentials
You need to re-authenticate with the correct credentials in OpenShift.

1.1 Log in to Docker Registry
sh
Copy
Edit
oc delete secret cdp-private-installer-docker-registry-secret
oc create secret docker-registry cdp-private-installer-docker-registry-secret \
    --docker-server=<DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL> \
    --docker-username=<DOCKER_USER> \
    --docker-password=<DOCKER_PASSWORD> \
    --docker-email=<EMAIL>
Replace:

<DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL> with your Docker registry (e.g., quay.io or docker.io).

<DOCKER_USER> and <DOCKER_PASSWORD> with your credentials.

<EMAIL> with your email.

1.2 Link Secret to the Default Service Account
sh
Copy
Edit
oc secrets link default cdp-private-installer-docker-registry-secret --for=pull
This ensures that OpenShift pulls images using the correct credentials.

Step 2: Fix Rook/Ceph and PVC Issues
The error indicates that the Vault pod is stuck due to unbound PersistentVolumeClaims.

2.1 Check PersistentVolumeClaims
sh
Copy
Edit
oc get pvc -n rook-ceph
If you see any unbound PVCs, ensure that a suitable storage class exists:

sh
Copy
Edit
oc get storageclass
If no default storage class is set, follow the storage class setup instructions from my previous response.

2.2 Restart Rook-Ceph Operator
sh
Copy
Edit
oc get pods -n rook-ceph | grep rook-ceph-operator
oc delete pod <ROOK_CEPH_OPERATOR_POD> -n rook-ceph
Replace <ROOK_CEPH_OPERATOR_POD> with the pod name from the first command.

2.3 Restart the Vault Pod
sh
Copy
Edit
oc delete pod vault-0 -n <NAMESPACE>
Replace <NAMESPACE> with the namespace where Vault is deployed.


echo "<DOCKER_PASSWORD>" | docker login <DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL> --username <DOCKER_USER> --password-stdin
