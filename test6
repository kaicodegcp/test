The error in your screenshot indicates a problem with the kubeconfig file, specifically a duplicate name issue in the contexts section. This means your kubeconfig contains multiple entries with the same name (eap_dev), causing conflicts.

Fix the Kubeconfig Duplicate Context Issue
Check the Kubeconfig File:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat ~/.kube/config
Look for multiple entries of eap_dev under contexts.

Manually Remove Duplicates:

Open the kubeconfig file in a text editor:

bash
Copy
Edit
vi ~/.kube/config
Identify and remove the duplicate contexts entries for eap_dev.

Save and exit.

Validate the Kubeconfig: After editing, check if it works:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc config view --minify
oc get nodes
If this works, retry your installation.

Test Context Switching:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc config get-contexts
oc config use-context <valid-context-name>
Retry the Installation: Once fixed, retry running your install-cdp.sh script.

Let me know if you still face issues! üöÄ

Since you're running the install-cdp.sh script through the Cloudera Console, you need to fix the kubeconfig file on the installation host where the script is being executed. Follow these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the Installation Host
Since you're deploying Cloudera Data Services (CDS) on OpenShift, the installation host is the machine where Cloudera Manager (CM) or the bootstrap script (install-cdp.sh) is running. You likely need to log in to the machine where this script is executing.

If you have direct SSH access, log in to the installation host:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh <your-installation-host>
If you're unsure, check which machine runs the deployment script from Cloudera Manager.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Check the Kubeconfig File
Once logged in to the installation host, check the kubeconfig file location. The error message suggests the kubeconfig is stored in /data/l/tmp/. Verify its contents:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat /data/l/tmp/download-and-execute-6bc996cb-34d2-406b-ac23-ca8da92349fd/kubeconfig
Or check the default location:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat ~/.kube/config
3Ô∏è‚É£ Remove Duplicate Context Entries
Open the kubeconfig file:

bash
Copy
Edit
vi /data/l/tmp/download-and-execute-6bc996cb-34d2-406b-ac23-ca8da92349fd/kubeconfig
Find and remove duplicate contexts named eap_dev.

Each context entry starts with - context:

Ensure there is only one unique entry per cluster.

Save and exit (Esc ‚Üí :wq).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Validate the Kubeconfig
After fixing the file, test the OpenShift connection:

bash
Copy
Edit
export KUBECONFIG=/data/l/tmp/download-and-execute-6bc996cb-34d2-406b-ac23-ca8da92349fd/kubeconfig
oc config get-contexts
oc config use-context <valid-context-name>
oc get nodes
If the issue persists, try setting the correct kubeconfig for Cloudera:

bash
Copy
Edit
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
